I can't believe its February of 2016 already, time has really flown past.

Reflecting the year 2015, I realised that I have not achieved many of my personal goals. Why? Because I don't think that I truly have one. For the last year my life has been pretty good, I have a job, a nice place to stay and a pretty good relationship with people around me, then why do I still feel unsatisfied with my life in 2015?

Having a good job and a happy life can make a person complacent. It is until you start noticing people around you moving onwards and upwards with their lives that you feel like you're getting left behind. When this happens it is inevitable that you start comparing yourself with the success of others, unwittingly leading yourself towards to downward spiral of doom and gloom.

I'll be honest and admit that I have, and still am feeling that way. However this year, the year 2016 I have decided to leave all forms of self pity and self judgement on my past efforts behind and start doing things that will lead to a more fulfilling life. Needless to say there will be some changes in my life.

Since the beginning of the year I have listed my personal goals for this year, and that was the first step.

One of my goals was to start an online journal. So Ta Daaaaa.. here it is!

This journal will bascially be a collection of my thoughts, experiences or anything that I feel like writing about. One of my goals is to improve on my English vocabulary and writing skills. So if I have written about something that does not make sense or is not gramatically correct, please let me know so that it can be corrected.

Thank you for reading my journal first entry. If you are Chinese I wish you a prosperous Chinese New Year of the Monkey, otherwise I wish that you have a fulfilling year ahead.
